## How to Create Fillable Forms

To create an interactive form, use the Prepare Forms tool. See Create a form from an existing document.

You can enable the Fill & Sign tools by going to File menu and choosing Save As Other > Acrobat Reader Extended PDF > Enable More Tools.

Interactive forms contain fields that you can select and fill in. Flat forms do not have interactive fields.

## Converting Multiple Files

Create multiple PDFs from multiple files by selecting the files you want to convert and using the batch processing feature.

This allows you to convert several documents at once, saving time and ensuring consistency across your document collection.

## Digital Signatures

Send a document to get signatures from others by using the Request E-signatures feature.

Open the PDF form in Acrobat, choose All tools > Request E-signatures, and add recipient email addresses in the order you want the document to be signed.
